# Dell Brateck Adapter

This is a 3D part to join the Dell monitor clip/stand to a [Brateck desk mount](http://www.lumi.cn/en/tv-monitor/monitor-table-mounts/ldt02-c024).

## Motivation

I purchased these stands and although they are advertised as being VESA compatible (100mm) they don't fit Dell monitors due to the recessed design of the Dell monitor mount. After pulling the Brateck adapter to pieces, and finding some 2nd hand Dell monitor stands, I decided it would be possible to join the two together in an unholy alliance.

## Parts Required

- 4x M4x10 bolts + nuts
- 3x M6x12 bolts
- (2nd hand) Dell Monitor stand
- A compatible Brateck desk mount

## Instructions

1. Pull apart the dell monitor until you are left with the bracket which fits into the back of the screen.
2. Print out the included adapter.
3. Remove the Brateck VESA mount and the front half of the ball joint.
4. Attach the adapter to the front half of the ball joint and then the Dell bracket.
5. Put everything back together and enjoy.
